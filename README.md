Design only the header again - Done

Tips:

1. Use padding only for providing space within an element - Made these changes in the current version
2. Don't hardcode heights and widths (for the most part) - Tried my best to not hardcode them
3. Use background colors and borders during debugging - Yes, I did that while coding.
4. Make sure each style is required - I checked and made sure about this
5. Media queries - widths should not overlap - Tried my best. Need some guidance on this.
6. Use flex grow, justify-content etc to set the widths dynamically - I used them this time.
7. Focus on one design guideline at a time - Yes, while coding I took care of this.
